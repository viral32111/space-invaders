# Space Invaders

This is a [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game clone for Windows which uses the [SFML C++ library](https://www.sfml-dev.org) that I made back in 2021.

The [stars texture](/Textures/Stars.png) was made in [Microsoft Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint).

The font is [Pilot Command](https://www.dafont.com/pilot-command.font).

Apologies in advance for the chaotic project structure, I apparently forgot to make a source code directory.
